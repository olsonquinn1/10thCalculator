Two subgroups of modifiers:
    low list: high on this list = a lower prio number, thus executed first
        -15 add tags
        -10 modifiers that depend on tags
        affect hit or wound probabilities
        -5  crit thresholds
        -4  reroll mod
        
    high lists: mods that rely on outcomes from other mods
        save modifiers
        crit effects (lethal hits, dev wds, sustained hits), rely on calculated crit chance
